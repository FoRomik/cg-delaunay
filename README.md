cg-delaunay
===========

Implementation of the Delaunay Triangulation Algorithm.
The current version has divide and conquer algorithm implemented with
horizontal, vertical and alternating cuts of vertex set at each recursive call
delaunay triangulation function.

Implements incremental insertion algorithm for constructing two-dimensional Delaunay triangulations, 
described by Leonidas J. Guibas and Jorge Stolfi, Primitives for the Manipulation of General 
Subdivisions and the Computation of Voronoi Diagrams, ACM Transactions on Graphics 4(2):74â€“123, April 1985.
